# Baseline.vs.Active.Behavior

## Baseline Definition
Baseline behavior represents the normal and expected network activity observed over time when the device operates under typical conditions.

This includes predictable communication patterns, irregular timing intervals, and traffic that aligns with user-driven actions or background system processes.

## Active Behavior
Active behavior refers to any noticeable increase or deviation from the established baseline.

Such behavior may be legitimate when associated with user activity, or suspicious when it occurs without a clear context or fails to return to baseline conditions.

## Hypotheses
Before performing further observation, the following hypotheses were established:

- Normal network activity should remain consistent with the defined baseline during periods of inactivity
- Legitimate active behavior should present as a temporary deviation from the baseline
- Active behavior is expected to return to baseline once user interaction ends
- Sustained deviation without user interaction may indicate abnormal behavior

## Observations
During observation, periods of normal activity aligned closely with the defined baseline.

Temporary increases in network activity were observed during user interaction and consistently returned to baseline afterward. No sustained deviations were observed during idle periods.

## Analysis
The observations support the initial hypotheses and demonstrate the importance of establishing a baseline before evaluating network behavior.

By comparing active periods against baseline conditions, it becomes possible to distinguish between legitimate usage and behavior that warrants further investigation.

## Conclusion
This project highlights how baseline analysis provides context for understanding network activity. Establishing normal behavior over time is essential for effective defensive security monitoring.

## Ethical Notice
All observations were conducted on a privately owned network using personal devices.  
This project focused exclusively on passive analysis for educational purposes.
